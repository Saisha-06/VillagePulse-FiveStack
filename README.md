# Village Pulse â€“ Real-Time Public Utility Reporting Platform

**Village Pulse** is a real-time public utility reporting platform that bridges the communication gap between rural citizens and government departments. It allows villagers to report local issues â€” such as power outages, tree falls, fire incidents, or roadblocks â€” using a simple text form, with optional photo uploads and automatic GPS tagging. These reports are shared with nearby users and displayed on a web dashboard for departments, where staff can track, update status, and upload proof of resolution. The system fosters transparency, faster response times, and more accountable public service delivery in rural areas.
